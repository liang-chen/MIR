# Onset Detection

Onset is defined as the beginning position of a note attack, which is an important feature to identify beats or segment music. To detect onsets, we usually look at a "reduced" version of original signal -- the onset envolope, and perform peak picking to localize candidate onsets. Usually the onset detection algorithms consists of three major steps: preprocessing, reduction and onset localization. In the reduction step, we need to define detection/ novelty funtions which manifests the occurence of transients. After reduction, we apply peak picking for localization.

Categories:
* Time domain approach (rarely used, due to unreliability)
* Spectral domain approach: HFC, SF (modulus), NWPD (phase), and RCD (complex domain). HFC, SF and RCD were only looking at amplitude increase but ignoring the decrease.
* Probabilistic models: [conditional ICA](http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~markp/2003/AbdallahPlumbley03-ica-probability.pdf)
* Data-drive approach: using CNN or [LSTM](http://ismir2010.ismir.net/proceedings/ismir2010-101.pdf).
